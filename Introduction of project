In computing, scheduling is the action of assigning resources to perform tasks. The resources may be processors, network links or expansion cards The tasks may be threads, processes or data flows
The scheduling activity is carried out by a process called scheduler. Schedulers are often designed so as to keep all computer resources busy (as in load balancing), allow multiple users to share system resources effectively, or to achieve a target quality-of-service.
Scheduling is fundamental to computation itself, and an intrinsic part of the  execution model of a computer system; the concept of scheduling makes it possible to have  computer multitasking with a single  Central Processing Unit(CPU).
These scheduling algorithms are implemented based on the userâ€™s requirements and are been used as seen fit to based on the required circumstances.
